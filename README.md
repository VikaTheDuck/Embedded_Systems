Labs done with Arduino board & TTGO Esp32 board

## Lab 2

## Lab 4  
One Bluetooth module connected to a TTGO sends beacons to a second Bluetooth module connected to another TTGO board. The receiving Bluetooth beacon turns on a green light when a correct beacon is recognised, and a red light when it is not. For the second part of the lab, the Bluetooth module detects if my phone's BT is turned on. If it is, the LED of the TTGO is turned on. When I turn off my BT, the LED turns off.

## Lab 5  
The BT receiver identifies at least two different users (two different phones who's bluetooth is turned on).  When one of the specific phones is detected, the device retrieves the sound settings from a cloud platform and plays a melody specific to that device (Tetris or Star Wars Theme). For part 2,
the user has an interface in the mobile phone to select the light and sound settings. The user can use the mobile phone to turn on/turn off via BT (or BLE) the buzzer connected to the TTGO board.
